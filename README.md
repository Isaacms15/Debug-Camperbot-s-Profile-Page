# Debug-Camperbot-s-Profile-Page
Fixed some messed-up HTML tags on Camperbotâ€™s profile page. All headings and paragraphs now work as they should.

This was a freeCodeCamp task where I had to fix some broken HTML.  

The code had a few mistakes like:
<heading2> instead of <h2>
<pp> instead of <p>
a dodgy <h3> tag with a syntax error  

I corrected the tags so the page actually works the way it should.  
Pretty simple, but a good reminder that small errors can break your whole page.
